# JavaScript - Homework 3: Code-Quiz
Module 6 Challenge: Code Quiz

## Description

Write a JavaScript program that runs a timed multiple-choice quiz for the user, with a starting time that counts down as soon as the quiz is started.

The app must include the following features/functionality:

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.

  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.

  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears

  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

  * When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score

### Tasks completed

* When the page is loaded and the 'Start Quiz' button is pressed, the questions will appear one by one, with time being subtracted for incorrect answers. At the end of the quiz their score will be displayed, with the ability to save this score with their intials.

* As an extra, I've added a 'dark mode' option which the user can toggle.
